# Disto-TRP
## Introduction
In this study we proposed a method named as Disto-TRP, that utilized the structural information obtained from AlphaFold to effectively identifying Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels.

Understanding the structure of protein is quite important since it assist to understand the function of proteins. Prediction of protein structure is a challenging task from many decades. Recently, the DeepMind released the latest version of AlphaFold that attempts to predict the structure of proteins.
